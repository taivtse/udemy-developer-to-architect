# 58. Database partitioning selection

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Database Partitioning Selection.png>)

**Highlight:**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Database Partitioning Selection (1).png>)

**Summarize:**

\- Range partitioning:&#x20;

&#x20;   \+ Hard to query data in a range of more than 1 node.

\- Hash partitioning:&#x20;

&#x20;   \+ This is suitable only where we have to fetch, update, insert, delete based on a key.

&#x20;   \+ If we would like to query in a range of ids, we have to do many query statements for each id.
