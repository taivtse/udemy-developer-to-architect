**Highlight:**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Specialized Services (SOAPREST-Services) (1).png>)

**Summarize:**

\- Can be used REST/ SOAP for public services, GRPC/ Thrift for internal services.

\- If we use the same DB for all microservices, it may lead to bottleneck problems -> need independent DB for each service.
