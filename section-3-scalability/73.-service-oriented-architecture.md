# 73. Service Oriented Architecture

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Service Oriented Architecture (1).png>)

**Highlight:**

**Summarize:**

\- SOA cons:

&#x20;   \+ Common interface schema (SOAP protocol)

&#x20;   \+ Common DB schema: each service can be had its own schema, but they share schemas together. One service can access its own schema and others.

\- SOA can be scaled vertically because the DB cannot be scaled horizontally if we use SQL DB.
