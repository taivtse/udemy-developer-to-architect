# 54. Asynchronous processing & scalability

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png>)

**Highlight:**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Asynchronous Processing & Scalability.png>)

**Summarize:**

\- For example, the database can handle 10,000req/s, and at the peak period of Order Service where is processing 20,000req/s. If without a queue in between, our service is going to reject all upcoming requests due to the load limitation of DB. With a queue in between, we can immediately write to that queue and offload the load to DB.

\- Queue Processing to reduce write loads.
