Summarize:

\- In Master-Slave: there are a few problems with async and sync mechanisms, we can use a hybrid solution that will combine 2 mechanisms by creating many Read Replica DB with Async mechanisms and one Backup DB which is used Sync mechanisms.

\- Master-Master is rarely used because we have to handle write conflicts which is really hard to achieve.
