# 75. Transactions in Micro-Services

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Micro-Services Transactions (1).png>)

**Highlight:**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Micro-Services Transactions.png>)

**Summarize:**

\- 2PC: for example, the Order service receives a book order request, it will make requests to other participant services to get promises regarding transactions that can be opened. After the Order service is done its job, it will make other requests to other participant services to commit the transactions.

\- Both 2PC/ 3PC have the same problem in case coordinator service goes down and the participant services will take a long time to release the transaction.

\- In the microservice architecture, we do not use 2PC/ 3PC.
