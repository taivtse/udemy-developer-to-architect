**Highlight:**

**Summarize:**

\- The webserver application should be stateless or stateful, but we do prefer stateless rather than stateful. However in some certain cases, for example, Websocket server, it should be stateful.

\- Intermediate services should be stateless.

\- Database absolutely must be stateful.
