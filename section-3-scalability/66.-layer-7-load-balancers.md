**Highlight:**

**Summarize:**

\- SSL Termination: if a client makes an HTTPS request to the LB, the SSL connection will be broken before routing to backend services. For this purpose, we will use a cert for public accessing, and some internal certs for private accessing -> maybe for security intention.

\- Reverse proxy: the LB acts as a reverse proxy.

\- Content-based routing: the LB routes requests based on the content of the requests, such as cookies, headers, URL,â€¦
