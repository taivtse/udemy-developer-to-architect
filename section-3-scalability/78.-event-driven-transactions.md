**Choreography vs. Orchestration:**

\- From the perspective of composing Web services to execute business processes, orchestration is a more flexible paradigm and has the following advantages over choreography:\
\- The coordination of component processes is centrally managed by a known coordinator.\
\- Web services can be incorporated without their being aware that they are taking part in a larger business process.\
\- Alternative scenarios can be put in place in case **** of faults occur.
