# 67. DNS as load balancer

![](<../.gitbook/assets/DNS as Load Balancer.png>)

**Highlight:**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/DNS as Load Balancer (1).png>)

**Summarize:**

\- DNS has many cool features but it's still not a good choice for the Load Balancer.

\- DNS can do a health check, but it will take some time to update the IP addresses which are alive due to time to live configuration. So that we may end up sending requests to an instance which is not healthy.
