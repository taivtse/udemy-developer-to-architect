# 68. Global server load balancing

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Global Server Load Balancing (1).png>)

**Highlight:**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Global Server Load Balancing.png>)

**Summarize:**

\- Because the event of the entire region going down is rare and not frequent so we can use DNS as a global load balancer.&#x20;

\- In case of an entire region goes down, the DNS can detect it and divert the requests to another region that is available.

\- With this purpose, our system may achieve higher performance due to geography and achieve high availability by DNS health checks and switchovers.
