# 46. Stateful replication in web applications

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (73).png>)

**Highlight:**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Web Stateful Replication.png>)

**Summarize:**

\- Session occupies memory: If a session needs 1 MB to store data, therefore the number of requests will be decreased due to memory issues. In this case, we need more nodes to handle more requests -> cost increasing.

\- In case a node goes down, the request will be routed to remaining nodes, and it has to get data from downstream and cache it again.
