**Highlight:**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Database Partitioning.png>)

**Summarize:**

\- Have 2 types of Horizontal Partitioning of Database:&#x20;

&#x20;   \+ Range partitioning: this approach is really complicated in case of increasing or decreasing the number of nodes or 1 node goes down. Have one more problem in terms of transactions when we modify records in many nodes.

&#x20;   \+ Hash partitioning: have the same problem in terms of transactions with the above solution.
