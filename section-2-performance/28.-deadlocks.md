# 28. Deadlocks

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png>)

**Highlight:**

**Summarize:**

\- Lock Ordering Related: we should acquire locks in the fixed global order of locks.&#x20;

\- Request Load Related: this usually happens when we use the same gateway for client and internal service communication. When the gateway thread pool is full by client request, service 1 can't call service 2 through the gateway.

&#x20;   \-> Solution 1: divide the thread pool into 2 pools (client, internal).

&#x20;   \-> Solution 2: use 2 gateways (client, internal).

&#x20;   \-> Solution 3: internal calls without gateway.
