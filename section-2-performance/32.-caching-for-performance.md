**Highlight:**

**Summarize:**

\- It does not make sense to cache the data that changes frequently, just cache the data don't change requently.

\- Session Cache: cache user data in the session.

\- Static Data Cache: HTML, CSS, JS. We can cache in reverse proxy or CDN.

\- HTTP Cache: we can cache images. If we cache an image, the next time browser does not make a call to the system, that particular image can be fetched locally through the local cache itself.
