# 24. Minimizing locking related contention

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (74).png>)

**Highlight:**

**Summarize:**

\- Reduce the duration for which a lock is held:

&#x20;   ****    + Remove all the code that they are not necessary to be locked out of the lock section (critical section).

&#x20;   \+ Lock splitting: split a bigger lock section into smaller sections, try to lock on other objects of those lock sections.

&#x20;   \+ Lock stripping: if we have a bunch of elements in a collection, all of them need to be synchronized. Let's think about partitioning those elements. Like in ConcurrentHashMap, generally the backing map will be split into 16 buckets, only lock on the bucket where the key is being modified.

\- Replace exclusive locks with coordination mechanisms:

&#x20;   \+ Use read/write lock:&#x20;

&#x20;       \> While a reader gets a lock, writers will be waiting for the reader to finish, **other readers** can get locks as well.

&#x20;       \> While the writer gets a lock, **no** **other writers** **and readers** can get lock.
