# 13. Minimizing memory access latency

**Highlight:**

**Summarize:**

\- Avoid memory bloat:&#x20;

&#x20;   \+ minimize codebase size, because the code base will be loaded to memory.

&#x20;   \+ Minimize heap size as small as possible, reduce GC efforts, reduce the chance to out of memory problem.

\- Weak/ Soft references: for example in a huge process we allocate large objects that may lead to OutOfMemoryError.

&#x20;   \+ SoftReference: The underlying object can survive garbage collection's several cycles as long as the JVM is able to recover enough memory without throwing OutOfMemoryError. This makes them a good candidate for keeping a memory-sensitive cache.

&#x20;   \+ WeakReference: The underlying object can be garbage collected just like a normal object. It can be useful for situations when an object is used multiple times repeatedly during an event, but then, will likely be used after a long time.

&#x20;   \-> In case of the application memory is going to be exhausted, the GC will reclaim memory from Weak and Soft references.

&#x20;   Example:

```
MyObject myObject = new MyObject("weak " + i);          
Reference<MyObject> ref = new WeakReference(myObject);

MyObject myObject = new MyObject("soft " + i);          
Reference<MyObject> ref = new SoftReference<>(myObject);
```

\- Multiple smaller processes: it generally happens when running a batch process, we should split a huge process into smaller processes by running in multiple nodes or JVMs.

\- Garbage collection algorithms: there are 2 main types of GC:

&#x20;   \+ Pause all processes to do GC: this is suited for a batch application.

&#x20;   \+ Run GC along with the main process: this is suited for live application (webserver).
