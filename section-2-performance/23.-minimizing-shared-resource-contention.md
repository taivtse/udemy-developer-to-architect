# 23. Minimizing shared resource contention

**Highlight:**

**Summarize:**

\- CPU/ Disk/ Network: can improve the contention problems if we apply Vertical Scaling. But before we do it, make sure every single request is already handled efficiently and we have taken care of other contention-related issues.

\- Listen Queue: we can config the webserver to increase Listen Queue size, but before we do it, make sure our system is able to process all the requests rapidly and make sure every single request is already handled efficiently and we have taken care of other contention related issues.

\- Thread Pool Size: depends on Wait Time, CPU Time, Number of CPUs.

&#x20;   \+ When Wait Time is zero (no any external calls, no blocking IO,â€¦) and CPU Time is extremely high.&#x20;

&#x20;       \> If the Thread Pool Size is larger than the number of CPU -> CPU utilization may go up to be 100%.

&#x20;       \> If the Thread Pool Size is equal to or less than the number of CPU -> CPU utilization will be less than before.

\- Connection Pool Size: this pool size we can set equal to the number of Thread Pool Size that the webserver application has to handle requests.

\- Vertical Scaling: doing this by increasing the capacity of the hardware.
