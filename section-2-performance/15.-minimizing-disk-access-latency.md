# 15. Minimizing disk access latency

**Highlight:**

**Summarize:**

\- Logging: There are 2 kinds of IO: random IO, sequential IO. Random IO is much slower than sequential IO.

&#x20;   \+ Sequential & Batch IO: use sequential IO to get the fastest IO speed and use batch IO to minimize context switch between write log and other jobs.

&#x20;   \+ Asynchronous Logging: prefer Async Logging rather than Sync Logging in most cases, except the logs data are critical and have to be logged completely in case of the system fails.

\- Web content files:

&#x20;   \+ Web content caching is very extremely important to avoid reading data frequently.

&#x20;   \+ Separate Static data and Dynamic data into 2 sides, use a reverse proxy to cache so that get better performance for static data.

&#x20;   \+ Page cache, Zero copy: use a reverse proxy.

\- DB Access Latency:

&#x20;   \+ Data caching to void disk accessing.

&#x20;   \+ Schema Optimization:&#x20;

&#x20;       \> If disk accessing is a big problem, then we need to avoid fetching data from many tables (join), try to denormalize data so that we can read data from one table instead of many tables.&#x20;

&#x20;       \> If disk access is not a big problem, try to normalize data to save memory.

&#x20;       \> Use indexes to get better read operations speed.

&#x20;   \+ Query Optimization: only fetch fields that we are needed. Schema Optimization goes hand in hand with Query Optimization.

&#x20;   \+ Higher IOPS, RAID, SSD Disk: upgrade hardware.
