# 22. Shared resource contention

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png>)

**Highlight:**

**Summarize:**

\- Connection pool: if the connection pool is full, the current thread will wait for a new connection.

\- Thread pool: the same as Connection Pool.

\- Listen/ Accept Queue: if many requests are getting access to a web server, those requests will go through Listen Queue first, then if the Accept Queue is not full, the webserver will accept the request and start processing. If the Listen Queue is full, the subsequent requests will be rejected.

\- CPU/ Disk/ Network:&#x20;

&#x20;   \+ CPU contention is the cause of threads, creating many threads.

&#x20;   \+ Disk contention is when we are accessing disk data in many threads, for example fetching database records.

&#x20;   \+ Network contention will see if we have many requests come in at the same time, the network is choked.

\- Locks: the biggest sort of contention.
