# 33. HTTP Caching of static data

**Summarize:**

\- Proxy Server Cache and Reverse Proxy Cache are built to cache static data**.**

\- We can consider Browser Cache and Reverse Proxy Cache as a private cache and Proxy Server Cache as public cache.



**How does a public cache or a private cache know that what data should be cashed?**

\- When a server returns a response to the client, it will set Cache-Control to the request header to let the Reverse Proxy Cache or Proxy Server Cache know weather the response needs to be cached or not.

\- Cache-Control types:

&#x20;   \+ No Cache: The browser or any intermediate caching system can cache the data but can not use that cached object without validating with the origin server.

&#x20;   \+ Must Revalidate: similarly with No Cache but the validation is done only after the max-age has already passed.

&#x20;   \+ No cache: no cache at all.

&#x20;   \+ Public: just cache public data which are useful for multiple users.

&#x20;   \+ Private: cache client data, example: profile image.

&#x20;   \+ Max-age: specify how long the browser or any intermediate caches can cache the data.

\- Reverse proxy as an internal system, may host all static data itself.

\- ETAG: specify a version for static data, that version will be tagged by the server. For example, Cache-Control is no-cache, ETAG is version 1, every time the client wants to use the cached data, it will validate with the origin server to verify the version is changed or not. If it doesn't change, the client will use the cached data.
