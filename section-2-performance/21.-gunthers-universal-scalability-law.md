# 21. Gunther's universal scalability law

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (77).png>)

**Highlight:**

**Summarize:**

\- Amdahl's law: the problem is Queueing.

\- Gunther's universal scalability law: the problems are Queueing and Coherence.

\- What is **Queueing**: this is related to serial requests.

\- What is **Coherence**: if we have a variable that will be shared with multiple threads. By default, the OS will copy that variable to the cache memory of each CPU. That action will lead to a data race condition between each thread.

In this case, we need to mark the variable as a **volatile** variable, which means every change of the variable will be updated to other CPU caches.

\-> The effort to do the update is **Coherence** so that if we have many volatile variables, the Coherence cost will also increase.

\-> In this case, if we increase the number of CPUs, the throughput will start decreasing (cost of updating volatile variables).

\==> The graph gets flattened because of Queueing.

\==> The graph comes down because of Coherence.
