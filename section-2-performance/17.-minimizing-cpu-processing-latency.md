# 17. Minimizing CPU processing latency

**Highlight:**

**Summarize:**

\- Batch/ Async IO:&#x20;

&#x20;   \+ Use batch to avoid CPU latency, also network overhead.

&#x20;   \+ Use Async IO to minimize context switching, for example, write log statements in an async thread.

\- Single-threaded model: such as Nginx, NodeJS. The idea is we still have multithread, but we just have only one main thread, don't create other threads. In case of the main thread interacting with IO, with will delegate the job to the IO thread, and it will continue doing other jobs, doesn't need to wait for the IO thread -> minimize CPU latency of context switching.

\- Thread pool size: do not create a large number of threads in a pool.

\- Multi-process in virtual env: to avoid interfering between multiple large processes, we should run those processes in multiple virtual env.
