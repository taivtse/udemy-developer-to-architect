# 12. Memory access latency

**Highlight:**

**Summarize:**

\- Finite heap memory: if we manage application memory not good, Garbage Collector will run very aggressively, so the performance will come down.

\- Large heap memory: when the heap memory is bigger than the physical memory that is available on the machine, the OS will have to use a hard disk to accommodate that much of extra heap memory that is allocated -> swapping data between physical memory and hard disk -> bring down the performance. Large heap memory will lead the GC to be slow.

\- GC Algorithm: the same as above.

\- Finite buffer memory: usually occurs in the database when it reads a record from hard disk to memory, modifies the record, and stores the record to hard disk.
